Hola also offers a commercial CDN service, specifically designed for video delivery. 

Hola client side code “auctions” each chunk of the video between the existing CDN and  multiple Hola CDN servers worldwide. First chunks are downloaded from the fastest servers and later chunks are downloaded from the lowest cost servers.  

Your video is played using chunks downloaded from multiple CDN servers, at high speed & reliability, with minimal cost. For more details, visit [HolaCDN website] (http://www.holacdn.com).

## [Does your site use progressive video? Reduce your CDN costs even more with the bandwidth saver ](https://github.com/spark-mv/cdn/blob/master/BWsaver_install.md) 

Progressive MP4/FLV is an easy way to deliver online video, but also wastes bandwidth. Simply put, video downloads in full, but most users don't view all the downloaded bytes. And you end up paying for the wasted bandwidth.

HolaCDN bandwidth saver will instantly reduce HolaCDN's effective cost by 30-40%. Simply add the JavaScript to your video pages. The bandwidth saver is automatically activated as part of HolaCDN. To implement HolaCDN, Follow the step-by-step instructions in [the guide] (https://github.com/spark-mv/cdn/blob/master/BWsaver_install.md).
